🚀 House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques | Kaggle Competition Experience 🏡📊

I recently participated in the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle, where I had the opportunity to apply my machine learning skills to predict house prices in Ames, Iowa. 🏠💰

🔹 Challenge Overview:
The dataset contained 79 features describing various aspects of residential homes, from lot size to basement quality. The goal was to build a predictive model for house prices using advanced regression techniques like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Feature Engineering.

🔹 Key Takeaways:
✅ Hands-on experience with feature selection & engineering
✅ Implemented advanced regression models to minimize RMSE
✅ Explored log transformations for improving predictions
✅ Gained insights into real estate pricing factors

This competition was a great learning experience for practicing data science in a real-world scenario and fine-tuning my machine learning skills! 📈

Looking forward to more such challenges! 🚀
